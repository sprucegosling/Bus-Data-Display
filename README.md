# Bus-Data-Display
Code to allow Arduino to contact UK Bus Open Data Stream and display bus position simply
## Development
Intention to develop a simple, cheap and low energy means of displaying bus data at a local bus stop.
Current platform is an Arduino MKR which is capable of connecting to wifi with the correct security protocol
Presently needs a local wifi connection which may be hard to implement at the bus stop location but that is a technical challenge for another day.
## Progress
Code has been in development but not in a very organised fashion, first attempt at using GitHub to orgaise code better and make more progress
